This website is built using the "Massively" template, designed by HTML5 UP. It's a text-heavy, article-oriented design featuring a large background image with a parallax implementation and scroll effects powered by Scrollex. While it deviates slightly from the typical one-page layout, it incorporates user feedback and showcases new techniques.
