								<h3>My Background</h3>
								<p>Hi, I am Sanja. I am a data analyst with a background in civil engineering. With nearly a decade of expertise as a leakage data analyst in the research department, I've developed strong skills in analyzing and interpreting complex data, particularly in the field of water loss reduction in water supply networks.</p>
								<h3>Me and Data Analytics</h3>
								<p>When it comes to me and data analytics, it's more than just a professional pursuitâ€”it's a passion and a commitment. I thrive on the challenge of unraveling complex data sets, transforming them into meaningful insights, and uncovering patterns that drive informed decision-making. This journey extends from supporting everyday business decisions to influencing global change.
								<p>My journey in data analytics is marked by a dedication to supporting organizations in leveraging their data to achieve tangible outcomes, from the initial exploration of raw data, through data preparation, analysis and management, all the way to impactful presentation of insights.</p>
								<p>I believe that effective communication of insights is as crucial as the analysis itself. It's not just about making evidence-driven decisions; it's about articulating these findings in a way that resonates and drives action.</p>
								<p>So, when it comes to me and data analytics, it's not just a profession; it's a dynamic partnership, a journey of exploration, and a commitment to making data a powerful catalyst for success.</p>
